There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.   \n",

When it came, we opened it right away, and were shocked when we were looking at the Percy instead of Thomas.We coulda/woulda/shoulda contacted the seller, but this \"Thomas\" product is already in our Tildsmen shed, since we opened the package with our son.With so many places to buy genuine Thomas gear, if you are paying the premium Thomas price, we expected a better product experience.   \n",
